					<p>
						Although I began my 26th year still living in the city that molded the first quarter-century of my life, my life already
						felt different. After
						<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-run-local-school-board">two bittersweet election years</a>, I had resolved to find a way to impact the world beyond politics. My first step
						involved finding a new professional role that utilized my strengths and changed lives without being overtly political.

					<p>
						In February 2017 I started a new role building out business and community partnerships for the
						<a href="https://chiefscienceofficers.org/national/">Chief Science Officers</a>, an organization with strong leadership, meaningful impact, and potential for international
						growth. It was a wonderful opportunity, but eventually it was clear that it wasn't the right opportunity for me.

					<p>
						A few months prior, I made a
						<a href="https://pingpongclub.win">small web application</a> to keep track of ping pong games for my coworkers at Oscar Health. Even though it was a trivial
						side project, and I was an inexperienced coder, I felt exhilarated when I my peers started using the app. Even as I
						moved on to the CSOs, I kept tinkering. By early Summer, I decided to become a developer.

						By this time, Erin had already decided to attend Columbia University for a Masters in Education Policy. New York City has
						a thriving technology ecosystem and world-class software engineering bootcamps, so I
						<a href="https://github.com/veekas/bootcampers-2017">analyzed some alumni surveys</a>, applied to the programs that had the best outcomes, and chose
						<a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com">Fullstack Academy</a>. We packed up the dogs and our lives and moved to NYC in late August.

					<p>
						They don't call it a bootcamp for nothing - I worked full days almost every day of the week for four months just to keep
						up with the curriculum. I developed a new stress wrinkle on my cheek that still hasn't faded. Even still, I enjoyed
						being a student more than I ever have before. It was project-based learning, and I was surrounded by extremely bright
						peers all working toward the same goal.

						I try to live by the programmer credo: 'Always Be Coding'. As a student, I helped build simplified versions of Twitter, Wikipedia,
						Spotify, and Amazon. My group capstone project was a
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9oYe_8Ks9M&t=23s">Chrome extension</a> that helps people practice coding on Youtube. I've also built an
						<a href="reasons-why-i-love-you.glitch.me">action for Google Assistant</a>, a
						<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=veekas.use-strict-everywhere">Microsoft VSCode extension</a>, and a handful of professional and personal websites (like this one). My favorite work-in-progress
						is a podcast player and recommendation engine.

						<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/11293143">reading books</a> at a pace I haven't matched since my early teens. I listened to an
						<a href="images/podcast-addiction.png">average of two hours</a> of podcasts per day, and I attended dozens of

						Now I begin another new chapter: the job search. I'm not sure where I'm going to end up, but I know I want to work on difficult
						challenges with other intelligent developers in NYC. I want to continue building useful tools, exploring new ideas,
						meeting people who are making a dent in the universe, and loving Erin and the doggos. If you know anyone who you'd
